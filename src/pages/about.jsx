          These courses were created by a college student in their 20s who wants to show others that college often teaches you how to be a good worker rather than how to think independently. Many classes in traditional curricula don’t prepare students with practical life skills. Enhanced Youth offers lessons on topics that most colleges and universities don’t teach. Begin your journey on the path to personal and professional growth today!
